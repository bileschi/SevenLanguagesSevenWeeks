Modify the given "CSV" application to support an 'each' method to return a CsvRow object.  Use method_missing on that CsvRow to return the value for the column for a given heading. 

For example, for the file:
--- snip ---
one, two
lions, tigers
---/snip/---

allow an API that works like this:

csv = RubyCsv.new
csv.each {|row| puts row.one}

this should print "lions"
