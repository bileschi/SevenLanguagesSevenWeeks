Find:
* Functions that you can use on lists, strings, or tuples
* A way to sort lists

The best way to find Haskell library functions is with Hoogle:
http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/

Here is the response to the query "sort"
http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Data-List.html#v:sort

It even includes source code and a link to the "sortBy" function
http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/src/Data-List.html#sort

To be a sport, here some functions that operate on lists 

[a] -> a
head
last
foldl1
find

[a] -> [a]
cycle
init
reverse
tail
