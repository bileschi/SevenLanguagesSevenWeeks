Find:
* Functions that you can use on lists, strings, or tuples
* A way to sort lists

Do:
* Write a sort that takes a list and returns a sorted list
* Write a sort that takes a list and a function that compares its two arguments and then returns a sorted list
* Write a Haskell function to convert a string to a anumber.  The string should be in the form $2,345,678.99 and can possibly have leading zeroes
* Write a function taht takes an argument x and returns a lazy sequence that has every third number, starting with x.  Then, write a function that includes every fifth number, beginning with y.  Combine these functions through composition to return every 8th number, beginning with x+y
* Use a partially applied function to define a function that will return half of a number and another that will append \n to the end of any string.

Do if you dare:
* Write a function to determine the greatest common denominator of two integers.
* Create a lazy sequency of prime numbers.
* Break a long string into individual lines at proper word boundaries.
*To the above excercise, add functions to left, right, and fully justify the text wtih spaces (making both margins straight)
