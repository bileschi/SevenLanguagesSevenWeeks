Do:
*How many different ways can you find to write allEven?
*Write a function that takes a list and returns the same list in reverse
*Write a functio that builds two-tuples witha ll possible combinations of the colors, black, white, blue, yellow, and red.  Note that you should only include one of (blue, black) and (black, blue)
*Write a list comprehension to build a childhood multiplication table.  The table would be a list of three-tuples where the first two are integers from 1-12 and the third is the product of the first two.
*Solve the map-coloring problem using Haskell

Map coloring = three colors
5 states
no two adjacent states have the same color
