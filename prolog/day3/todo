---- find:
-- predicates for printing / reading
http://www.gprolog.org/manual/gprolog.html#htoc157

-- how do predicates for printing only successful solutions work?
via stack overflow:
print_all_solutions :-
  solution(Sol),
  write(Sol),
  fail. % this causes backtracking
print_all_solutions. % succed

---- do:
-- modify sudoku solution to solve a 9x9 puzzle.
-- make the sudoku solver print prettier solutions.
-- Solve the eight queens puzzle by taking a list of queens.  Rather than a tuple, represent each queen as an integer, from 1 to 8. Get the row of the queen from its position in the list, and the column from the value in the list.
